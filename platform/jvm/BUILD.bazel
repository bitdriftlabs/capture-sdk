# JNI Implementation

# This shared library is consumed by the jvm targets which produce a file located
# at src/platform/jvm named either libcapture.so or libcapture.dylib depending on the platform.
# This allows the JniLibrary to load this with the name "capture" when the library path is set
# to src/platform/jvm.
