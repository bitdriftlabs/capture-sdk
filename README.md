# Capture SDK

The bitdrift Capture SDK is a highly optimized, lightweight library built to enable high volume, low overhead local telemetry storage and persistence. Controlled in real-time by the bitdrift control plane, the SDK selectively uploads the precise data needed to debug customer issues, and nothing more.

See [here](https://docs.bitdrift.io/product/overview) for more information.

For setup, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/bitdriftlabs/capture-sdk/wiki)
